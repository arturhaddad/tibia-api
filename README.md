# Tibia Character API
> API Rest to consult informations about tibia characters

## How it works
Unfortunally, [Cipsoft](https://www.cipsoft.com/index.php/en/) doens't provide an API to get any information about **Tibia Chararacters**. So, I've created this API which receives a character name and scrapps tibia website bringing general informations about the character.

## Tecnhologies used
The first version was wrote using a simple POST. But now, I refactored to use GraphQL. You can use the panel to check it out the informations and make queries or you can consume it by a HTTP POST. Following the explanation to use both methods.

## API

### GraphQL Panel

- URL: [https://api-tibia.herokuapp.com/graphql/player](https://api-tibia.herokuapp.com/graphql/player)

To consult a player informations using this panel, you must write a query passing the character name and which informations you'd like to receive, for example:

```graphql
query{
  character(characterName: "mad dentist") {
    name
    sex
    vocation
    level
    achievmentPoint
    world
    residence
    lastLogin
    accountStatus
  }
}
```
And you'll receive a JSON like this:

### REST: Post
- URL: [https://api-tibia.herokuapp.com/graphql/player](https://api-tibia.herokuapp.com/graphql/player)

To consume this API using HTTP POST, you must send a **header** requiring an 'application/json' and send a JSON with one key (query) and the same query made on GraphQL panel. 

```json
{
	"query": "{ character(characterName: \"mad dentist\") {name sex vocation level achievmentPoint world residence lastLogin } }"
}
```

How we can see, it's the same query, but just in one line.

## Response

    "data": {

            "world": "String",
            "residence": "String",
            "lastLogin": "String"
        }
    }
}
```
