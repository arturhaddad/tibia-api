# Tibia Character API
> API Rest to consult informations about tibia characters

## How it works
Unfortunally, [Cipsoft](https://www.cipsoft.com/index.php/en/) doens't provide an API to get any information about **Tibia** Chararacters. So, I've create this API which recieves a POST method with a **name** in body content and make a requisition to Tibia website to consult all the informations about this character. The API read the result and return an object with all informations.
